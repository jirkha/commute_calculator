## DESCRIPTION

It's nice to fulfill your dream, but let's face it, charging for a new home can cause the same negative consequences as receiving a so-called danai gift. That is, you live in your dream house or apartment, but instead of the benefits and satisfaction you experience when you wake up, you mainly experience difficulties. This is due to the fact that very few people are really aware of all the contexts beforehand and are mainly interested in the price, size, and in the best case, the distance from schools to work when they intend to buy their home. But there is one big BUT. It's something else when a real estate agent tells you that the new apartment is on the metro (in reality you have to take a 10 min. bus ride to the metro), that the new house is 30 min. to the center of Prague, but the reality is at least double that in the morning rush hour. The best option would be if everyone could move into the new home for at least 14 days on a trial basis and experience everything that awaits you in real life. Unfortunately, since this option is not possible in the vast majority of cases, our calculator is here to tell you in black and white how much free time you will lose if you move further away from your current job.

Do you want to spend 8 hours longer on transport each week and lose 8 hours of free time? That's one full working day. Now wouldn't you volunteer to go to work on Saturday if your hours are Monday through Friday? In our experience, people (and we get it) only have the vision of their new home in front of them, and at most they make sure it makes up for any shortcomings. Yes, it does. But only for a while. After a couple of months, you fully realise the implications of the big difference of getting up at 5am when originally it was only 6am. That the daily commute of half an hour longer to work is really an hour (if you include the return journey), etc. 

Our app will show you what you may have to sacrifice and it's up to you whether you think more about your new home or take all the risks at the expense of your valuable free time.
